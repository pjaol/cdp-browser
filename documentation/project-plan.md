## Accomplishments

### Docker + CDP Setup (Sprint 1)
- âœ… Created a Dockerfile based on browserless/chrome for ARM64 compatibility
- âœ… Implemented a custom startup script (entrypoint.sh) to configure Chrome with proper flags
- âœ… Added support for headless mode with the `--headless=new` flag
- âœ… Implemented proxy server support via environment variables
- âœ… Created a WebSocket proxy (proxy.js) to allow remote connections to Chrome
- âœ… Configured proper port exposure (9222 for Chrome, 9223 for proxy)
- âœ… Successfully tested the Docker setup with example scripts

### Core Functionality (Sprint 2)
- âœ… Enhanced Page/Tab management with automatic discovery and event listeners
- âœ… Improved navigation controls (back, forward, reload, wait for navigation)
- âœ… Added robust error handling with specific exception types
- âœ… Implemented advanced form interaction methods (fill_form, check, select)
- âœ… Added support for keyboard combinations and special keys
- âœ… Implemented viewport manipulation (set_viewport, reset_viewport)
- âœ… Added methods for getting HTML and text content
- âœ… Implemented waiting utilities (wait_for_selector, wait_for_function)
- âœ… Extended the test suite with comprehensive tests for navigation and input

### Stealth & Polish (Sprint 3)
- ðŸ”´ Stealth features to avoid detection
- ðŸ”´ Advanced interaction methods
- ðŸ”´ Complete documentation
- ðŸ”´ CI/CD pipeline setup

## Current Focus

We are now focusing on:
1. Planning for Sprint 3 implementation
2. Researching stealth techniques to avoid bot detection
3. Designing CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

## Next Steps

Begin Sprint 3:
- Implement stealth features to avoid bot detection:
  - Randomize mouse movements
  - Add natural typing patterns
  - Modify browser fingerprints
  - Implement evasion techniques for common detection methods
- Add advanced interaction methods:
  - File upload/download handling
  - Multi-page management
  - Network request interception
- Complete comprehensive documentation:
  - API reference
  - Usage examples
  - Best practices
- Set up CI/CD pipeline:
  - Automated testing
  - Docker image building
  - Version management

## Key Implementation Notes

1. **No Selenium Approach**
   - Project explicitly avoids Selenium due to ARM64 compatibility issues
   - Uses direct Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) communication
   - Implements custom browser control methods

2. **Hardware Compatibility**
   - All components designed for ARM64 architecture
   - Docker base image: browserless/chrome:latest for ARM64
   - Native dependencies only

3. **WebSocket Proxy**
   - Implemented a Node.js-based WebSocket proxy for remote connections
   - Proxy listens on port 9223 and forwards to Chrome on port 9222
   - Handles browser instance ID management
   - Provides better stability for remote connections

4. **Enhanced Browser Control**
   - Improved Page/Tab management with automatic discovery
   - Advanced navigation controls with history management
   - Robust input simulation with support for various input types
   - Comprehensive error handling with specific exception types

5. **Risk Mitigation**
   - Regular testing on target hardware
   - Comprehensive test suite for core functionality
   - Performance monitoring
   - Documentation updates with each sprint 

## Timeline

- Sprint 1: âœ… Completed
- Sprint 2: âœ… Completed
- Sprint 3: ðŸ”´ Not Started (Expected completion: 2-3 weeks)
- Total estimated time remaining: 2-3 weeks
