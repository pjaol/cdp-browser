## Accomplishments

### Docker + CDP Setup (Sprint 1)
- âœ… Created a Dockerfile based on browserless/chrome for ARM64 compatibility
- âœ… Implemented a custom startup script (entrypoint.sh) to configure Chrome with proper flags
- âœ… Added support for headless mode with the `--headless=new` flag
- âœ… Implemented proxy server support via environment variables
- âœ… Created a WebSocket proxy (proxy.js) to allow remote connections to Chrome
- âœ… Configured proper port exposure (9222 for Chrome, 9223 for proxy)
- âœ… Successfully tested the Docker setup with example scripts

### Core Functionality (Sprint 2)
- âœ… Implemented example scripts for basic browser interactions
- âœ… Added screenshot capabilities with proper encoding
- âœ… Created form interaction examples
- âœ… Implemented content retrieval functionality
- âœ… Added direct CDP protocol usage examples
- ðŸŸ¡ Basic Page/Tab management (in progress)
- ðŸŸ¡ Navigation controls (in progress)

### Stealth & Polish (Sprint 3)
- ðŸ”´ Stealth features to avoid detection
- ðŸ”´ Advanced interaction methods
- ðŸ”´ Complete documentation
- ðŸ”´ CI/CD pipeline setup

## Current Focus

We are currently focusing on:
1. Enhancing the core browser interaction functionality
2. Improving error handling and stability
3. Extending the test suite for better coverage
4. Refining the Page/Tab management system

## Next Steps

1. Complete the remaining tasks in Sprint 2:
   - Enhance Page/Tab management
   - Improve navigation controls
   - Add more robust error handling
   - Extend the test suite

2. Begin Sprint 3:
   - Implement stealth features to avoid bot detection
   - Add advanced interaction methods
   - Complete comprehensive documentation
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline

## Key Implementation Notes

1. **No Selenium Approach**
   - Project explicitly avoids Selenium due to ARM64 compatibility issues
   - Uses direct Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) communication
   - Implements custom browser control methods

2. **Hardware Compatibility**
   - All components designed for ARM64 architecture
   - Docker base image: browserless/chrome:latest for ARM64
   - Native dependencies only

3. **WebSocket Proxy**
   - Implemented a Node.js-based WebSocket proxy for remote connections
   - Proxy listens on port 9223 and forwards to Chrome on port 9222
   - Handles browser instance ID management
   - Provides better stability for remote connections

4. **Risk Mitigation**
   - Regular testing on target hardware
   - Continuous integration checks
   - Performance monitoring
   - Documentation updates with each sprint 

## Timeline

- Sprint 1: âœ… Completed
- Sprint 2: ðŸŸ¡ In Progress (Expected completion: 1-2 weeks)
- Sprint 3: ðŸ”´ Not Started (Expected start: After Sprint 2 completion)
- Total estimated time remaining: 3-5 weeks
